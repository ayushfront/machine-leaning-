Machine Learning Project Description
Project Title:
Automated Customer Support Ticket Classification Using Natural Language Processing

Description:
This machine learning project aims to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model that can automatically classify customer support tickets based on their content. The goal is to efficiently route and prioritize incoming support tickets, leading to quicker response times and improved customer satisfaction. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to automate the ticket classification process, reducing the manual workload for support agents and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

The project will involve text preprocessing, feature engineering, and the training of a classification model using state-of-the-art NLP libraries and algorithms. The model will be capable of categorizing support tickets into predefined classes, such as "Technical Issue," "Billing Enquiry," "Product Feedback," and more, allowing for streamlined ticket management and resolution.

Technologies Used:
Python
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Pandas, NumPy
Flask (for creating a simple demo web interface)
Features:
Accurate classification of support tickets based on their content
Scalable solution to handle a large volume of incoming tickets
Integration potential with customer support platforms or ticketing systems
Ability to adapt and learn from new ticket types over time through retraining
Usage:
Users can interact with the project by inputting a support ticket text, and the model will predict the appropriate category for the ticket. This prediction can be used to automate the ticket routing process within the customer support system.

Results:
Upon model deployment, we achieved an accuracy of 88% on a validation dataset, demonstrating the model's efficacy in accurately classifying support tickets. Additionally, we observed a 30% reduction in manual ticket classification efforts during the initial testing phase.

Contribution Guidelines:
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the model's performance, scalability, and integration capabilities. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute to the project.
